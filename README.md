# Ticketing System - Fullstack Project

This project was developed as part of the **Web Development** course in the **Software Engineering** program at the **Instituto Federal da Bahia (IFBA)**. It is a **ticketing system** designed to manage customer support requests, featuring a complete **Single Page Application (SPA)** frontend and a **RESTful API** backend.

I still love this project cause it was my first time working on both, back and front-end.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: Used to build the Single Page Application (SPA) architecture for seamless user experience.
- **HTML** & **CSS**: For structuring and styling the interface.

### Backend:
- **Java**: Core language for the backend logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Utilized the MVC pattern to organize the code and facilitate clean, maintainable architecture.
- **Spring Security**: Implemented for authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication and storage.
- **Swagger**: Integrated for API documentation, making it easy for developers to understand and test the endpoints.

## Key Features
- **Ticket Creation**: Users can create support tickets through the SPA frontend.
- **User Authentication**: Firebase handles secure user registration and login.
- **Role-Based Access**: Spring Security ensures that different user roles (admin, support agent, customer) have appropriate permissions.
- **Ticket Management**: Tickets can be viewed, updated, and managed via the RESTful API.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger provides interactive documentation for testing and understanding the API structure.

## Learning Outcomes
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with fullstack development, focusing on building a functional web application from frontend to backend. It enhanced my skills in:
- Developing SPA with React.
- Implementing secure APIs using Java and Spring Boot.
- Managing user authentication and authorization with Firebase and Spring Security.
- Creating comprehensive API documentation with Swagger.
